## 🌍 About the Project

**DevNity InnoVations** is an initiative to modernize traditional education systems by introducing **interactive, tech driven learning tools**.  
We create digital simulations, visual experiments, and smart learning modules that help students **see**, **feel**, and **interact** with the concepts they study instead of just reading them.

Our goal:  
> “Make complex science simple, and learning an experience, not a lecture.”
